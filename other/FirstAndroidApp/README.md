# FirstAndroidApp

## WHY

The main focus of this mini project is so that I learn the hard basics of android development. Main things I want to learn are:

- basics of how the android studio works
- how can I make a button do something
- how can I switch between layouts
- how to integrate a database

After this I will start a bigger project, a simple light weight gym app.

## WHAT IS IT

This is a android app, that lets the user press the button and display how many times he has pressed it. The app allows a user to log in with their name, press a button to increment a counter, and view the total number of presses they've made over time.
